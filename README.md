# tabular-playground-series-jun-2022-kaggle
Welcome
Here you will find my kaggle competition notebook for the tabular-playground-series for the month of june.
for running the nootebook you need two csv files which you can download from the csv file folder.
In this month competition we have to predict the values for the missing data.
i have used the standard approach i.e using mean of that particular column, i have replaced the nan values with the mean.
If the model is modified further then you will see the update soon.
Feel free to ommit changes and provide solution.
happy learning.
